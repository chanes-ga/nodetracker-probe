This document describes usage of the data collection and service monitoring scripts used by NodeTracker.


OVERVIEW

Code consists of one primary script and multiple packages.

probe.pl
This is the primary script.  It walks all switches and routers to gather basic topology data, gathers SNMP data for any custom probes 
you have configured, and runs NMAP against specified devices to identify OS and open tcp ports.  It also does email notifications of 
out-of-bounds values on probes for which "Monitor Standard Deviation" is turned on.



GETTING STARTED

1) You need the latest version of Perl.  For the Windows platform, use Active Perl available from http://www.activestate.com.

2) The following Perl packages are required by the above scripts.  These packages are available from http://www.cpan.org for the 
Unix/Linux platform and from http://www.activestate.com if you are using a Windows platform.

DBI
DBD-Mysql
TimeDate
Net-SNMP
Net-DNS
Mail-Sendmail
Crypt-Blowfish
MIME-Base64

Install these packages.  On the Windows platform, the easiest way to install the packages is by using PPM (the perl package manager).  
From a command prompt, goto the bin directory of your perl distribution (e.g. c:\perl\bin) and type "ppm".  Once ppm is started, you can 
install a package by type "install the-package-name" (e.g. "install DBI").


3) If on a Unix/Linux platform, obtain nmap 2.54 or greater from http://www.insecure.org and install it.  
   If on a Windows platform, obtain the NT port of nmap from http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Tools/nmapnt.html.  
   IMPORTANT NOTE for Windows users: do not use the libpcap drives included with the nmapnt download.  Rather use the latest 
   version from http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap/.

4) Edit nodetracker.conf as needed.  Mostly this will entail changing some directory paths.

5) Your done.  Now you just need try running the script.  The required command line options are
"-u username -p password -d databasename -e emailaddressforalerts -k privateEncryptionKey".  For example, you would have 
something like "perl probe.pl -u joe -p mysecret -d mydatabase -e joe@yahoo.com -k mysecret".
